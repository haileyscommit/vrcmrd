# VRChat Moderation Reference Dashboard
Gives each moderator of a group knowledge and understanding of all users in a lobby, including what avatars they're in and stuff. It's basically a re-implementation of Scarlet, but networked so you don't have to live-stream it & each mod gets more read-only access to stuff, and hopefully generally better.
